# 👋 Hi, I'm Benson

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

I am currently building tools that bring **LLMs** into real-world workflows, things like semantic search, browser extensions, and lightweight RAG systems that enhance productivity and learning.

I'm also deeply interested in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and its applications in decision-making, agents, and long-term planning. I am researching and publishing in this space and trying to build a stronger foundation for contributing to open problems in RL and AI research.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, SQL, C, C++  
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, NextJs  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Other:** Git, VSCode, Spark, Hadoop, 

## 🔍 Interests

- Reinforcement Learning & decision-making systems  
- LLMs + RAG search 
- Human-AI collaboration tools  
- Scalable knowledge retrieval & summarization
